> **About this project...** <br>
ðŸ¥‘ I worked for this American company that came up with this cutting-edge **Computer Vision and AI model** for recognizing patterns within fast-food chains' kitchens to predict and prevent issues, thus improving processes and quality while cutting expenses. They caught the eyes of industry titans such as **McDonalds**, **KFC**, and **Taco Bell**. Back then, their business model appeared solid, and their team was constituted of at most sixty people, from devs to field technicians. <br>ðŸ”¥ Since they were concentrating on (and still running) MVPs and PoCs, they faced a common issue numerous startups share: **no Documentation Culture**. Nearly every process and task was carried out without being properly documented, from technical specifications to post-mortems, from user stories to customer-facing product docs, from incident tickets to troubleshooting and support handbooks. I took on the role of their **Tech Writer**. The CEO himself assigned me the vital task of consolidating and converging all internal documentation into a robust (and nice-looking) **Knowledge Base**. While I was still getting used to their operation, projects' specifics, and teams' dynamics, I noticed there was a vital gear missing in the whole mechanism: They did not have a **Service Desk Portal** for the customers to report incidents (Every single issue was reported via email or over a direct phone line). <br> ðŸš€ Lucky me, I had already been in a company that went through a similar situation. This allowed me to come up with a solution. I designed an **Incident Management Process** layout for their **Support Agents**, to implement in conjunction with a **Help Desk Solution** where their Customers could report issues and request assistance, and a series of **FAQ** inputs and **Help Articles** for their Field Technicians to consult. The following document was intended to be the project's specification cover, which I used as a cue for my presentation.
