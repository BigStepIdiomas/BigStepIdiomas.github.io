title: Field Technicians Troubleshooting
description: Thus, they were granted the treasure map...

## Use Case

The company (let's call it _DoxHut_) was performing **PoCs** and running tests directly on what we can call a production environment. The software solution was implemented on a piece of software already established within the customer's facilities. Although it was _code_ injected in an application, it required various pieces of hardware installation and frequent maintenance. <br>
The challenge, however, was the team available to cover eventual incidents. Since we were **dealing with hardware**, on-site analysis was often inevitable. The team was mainly constituted of two levels: <br>
- **SREs**, in charge of controlling the servers' stability and, among other things, running a second level of analysis, usually requested by the Field Technicians, once they run the first instance of analysis and got confirmation on the issue not being related to the hardware installation's status. <br>
- **Field Technicians**, mostly constituted by interns, most of them part-time, and distributed across the country so that in-situ assistance was feasible. <br
As soon as I learned what they did and how they did it, I noticed most of the incidents were time-sensitive, and the two instances of analysis had to occur swiftly and efficiently. To contribute to this cause, I interviewed **SMEs** from both sides, gathered all information on common issues and the steps to achieve their resolution, created a rough draft, validated it with them, and published the following **Help Docs page** for **troubleshooting** the issues they faced on a daily basis.
