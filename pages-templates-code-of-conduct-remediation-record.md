# Template Code of Conduct remediation record

---
The Code of Conduct remediation record template includes:

* Placeholder text that you can replace with your own text. This text is indicated in {curly braces}.
* Writing instructions, also in {curly braces}.
* A supplementary Code of Conduct remediation record guide that provides more detailed information about using this template. Read the guide document first! This guide is located in the same folder as the template and is named `about-code-of-conduct-remediation-record.md`.
* The Code of Conduct remediation template should be used along with several other templates, including:
  * A Code of Conduct that you can use to create and explain your community's Code of Conduct. This template is included in the same folder as this template and is named `template-code-of-conduct.md`. See its accompany guide: `about-code-of-conduct.md`.
  * A Code of Conduct response plan template that you can use to create and explain the policy your team will follow as you handle Code of Conduct incidents. This template is included in the same folder as the Code of Conduct template and is named `template-code-of-conduct-response-plan.md`. See its accompany guide: `about-code-of-conduct-response-plan.md`.
  * A Code of Conduct incident record template for a form that is filled out when a community moderator takes an incident report from a community member. This template is included in the same folder as the Code of Conduct template and is named `template-code-of-conduct-incident-record.md`. See its accompany guide: `about-code-of-conduct-incident-record.md`.

You might also consider using the `../our-team/template-our-team.md` template to let your community members know who they can contact to report a Code of Conduct violation. This document is useful beyond Code of Conduct violations. It is a core document that helps you clearly communicate who belongs to your open source project or organization.

TIPS FOR THE COMMUNITY MODERATOR:
When meeting with a community member to explain the outcome of a Code of Conduct violation, strive for these goals:

* **Preparation** - Simply tell the community member beforehand that you wish to discuss an issue privately. Invite only one other community moderator for support if needed.
* **Calmness** - When explaining what behavior prompted the Code of Conduct investigation, calmly state what the behavior was without judgment or emotion. State the impact on the incident reporter or the community.
* **Clarity** - Set a clear behavior modification plan. If possible, get the community member to agree to this plan.
* **Privacy** - Do not disclose the identity of the incident reporter or allow them to be contacted. If the community member under investigation wants to contact the incident reporter to apologize, explain that you can take the apology on their behalf. With your permission, a public apology may be acceptable under the circumstances.
