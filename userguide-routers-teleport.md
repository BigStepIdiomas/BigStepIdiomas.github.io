## Creating Passwords for Stores' Routers on LastPass

To create a section for each store‚Äôs router password on LastPass:

1. Access Agot‚Äôs LastPass Password Manager panel.
2. Create a New Item by clicking the plus sign located at the bottom right corner. This action will open a modal where you must fill in a few fields. <br> ![createnew](images-changingpasswords-createnew.png)
3. Fill in the Name field with the server‚Äôs name.
4. Fill in the Folder field with the ‚ÄúShared-stores‚Äù value.
5. Fill in the Username with ‚Äúroot.‚Äù

## Accessing a Server

To access a server:

1. List the existing servers by running: <br>
`tsh ls` <br>
   You will see all servers listed as shown next

![servers](images-changingpasswords-serverslist.png)

2. Select a server and access it:<br>
`tsh ssh doxhut@doxhut-2-xavier-0` (example)

3. Then, access the router:<br>
`ssh root@192.168.1.1`

4. Once in the router, change its password by running:<br>
`passwd`

5. You will get a confirmation message and that‚Äôs it!<br>

## Setting SREs SSH RSA Keys

To set an SREs SSH RSA key in the router:<br>

1. Run:<br>
`cd /root`

2. List all directories:<br>
`ls -hal`

3. Open .ssh<br>
`cd .ssh`

4. Then, edit the authorized keys<br>
`vim authorized_keys`

5. Once on the **Vim editor**, press **‚Äúi‚Äù** to activate the editor mode.<br>

6. Paste one of the SSH RSA keys.<br>

7. Press **‚ÄúEsc‚Äù** to exit edit mode.<br>

8. Press **‚Äúo‚Äù** to jump into the next line.<br>

9. Press **‚Äúi‚Äù** to activate the editor mode and paste a second key.<br>

10. Repeat as many times as keys you must insert in the file.<br>

11. Finally, make sure you are not in the editor mode, and press **‚Äú:wq‚Äù** to save changes and quit. <br>

## Bonus: Setting Server‚Äôs Time

Since you are already on the server, use the chance to set the server‚Äôs time by running:

`uci set system.ntp.enable_server='1' ; uci commit system ; /etc/init.d/sysntpd restart`

> üí° **Note**: You will not get any confirmation message for this last step.
